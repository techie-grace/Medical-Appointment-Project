## INSIGHTS
1. They're more females
2. Those who showed up for their appointment were over 88,000. 
3. More than half of the patients do not have scholarship, had no disabilities, were non alcoholic, did not have diabetes, did not have hypertension and didn't receive SMS.
4. Wednesdays had the highest number of appointments while May is the month with the highest number of appointment.
5. Adults aged 20 to 59 had the highest number of appointments. 

Further exploratory analysis of the data showed that:
- Although Wednesdays have the most number of appointment patients are most likely to keep the appointment scheduled for Thursdays. Saturdays are least appointment day likely to be kept.
- A large portion of appointments are made by  adults(20 to 59), but less than 80% show up for their appointment. Over 80% of all seniors 60 and above who made an appointment shows up for it.
- The total average wait time for appointments is 10 days. The average wait time for patients who showed up for their appointment is 9 days while for those who didn't show up for their appointment it is 16 days.
- Seniors wait an average of 11 days while teens wait an average of 9 days.
- Children who missed their appointment waited an average of 17 days.
- 79.69% of females showed up for their appointment while 80.03% of males showed up for their appointment.
- JARDIM CAMBURI has the most patients and the highest number of show ups and missed appointments.
- PARQUE INDUSTRIAL has only one patient who shows up for their appointment.
